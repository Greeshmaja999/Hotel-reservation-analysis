# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis
- About the Project

In this project, I studied hotel booking cancellations. Many hotels lose money because customers book rooms but later cancel them. I wanted to know why people cancel bookings and how hotels can reduce cancellations.

- Steps I Followed

Data Collection – Took data of hotel bookings from 2015–2017.

Data Cleaning – Removed mistakes and prepared the data.

Data Analysis – Checked different reasons for cancellations.

Data Visualization – Made graphs to understand results better.

Conclusions – Found useful insights.

Suggestions – Gave ideas to hotels for improvement.

- Research Questions

What are the main things that cause hotel booking cancellations?

How can cancellations be reduced?

How can hotels use this study for pricing and promotions?

- Key Findings

37% of bookings got cancelled, which is a big loss for hotels.

City hotels got more bookings than resort hotels.

Prices affect cancellations – Higher prices lead to more cancellations.

August had the most bookings and cancellations.

January had the highest cancellations compared to other months.

Most customers (46%) booked through online travel agents and not directly.

Top cancellations came from Portugal.

- Suggestions for Hotels

Keep prices lower or give discounts, especially on holidays and weekends.

Provide more offers in January to reduce cancellations.

Improve hotel services and quality, especially in Portugal.

Use advertisements and campaigns to attract more direct bookings.

- Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

- Conclusion

The project shows that price is the biggest reason for cancellations. Hotels can earn more by managing prices smartly, giving discounts, and improving services.
